# real_time_weather_prediction

Hello,

In this project, we will create a system for data ingestion and weather prediction. The end result of the this project is a service that allows users to predict the weather 24 hours from now for various cities around the world such as: Paris, London, Berlin, Madrid and more. 

The project includes:

1. Data pipeline for transferring weather data to Google BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage.

2. Training a Gradient Boosting Regressor Model

3. API for interacting with the model and grabbing the weather predictions.
